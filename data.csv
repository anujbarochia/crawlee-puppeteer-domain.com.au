We have many house/land packages or townhouses available across the Eastern Sea Board of Australia.

All building contracts will be a fixed-priced turned-key package, which means that you just move in as all the work has been completed. e.g. Landscaping with fences and driveway, carpet/blinds/clotheslines & letterbox. 

Your new home/townhouse will have all the bells and whistle like an air conditioning split system to cool or heat in those changing seasons. 

The kitchen will have all the modern cons, like an automatic dishwasher with modern appliances. Amazing! Flooring will consist of tiles or planking in the living areas and carpet for all the bedrooms. 

Getting your car in and out of the garage with your remote control will be a breeze. 

With your new home completed, you can relax and enjoy family and friends knowing that you will have no more inspections, no more moving, and no more questions about what pets you can have. WOW, What a Life!

Step 1. Complete Your Name, Email & Mobile Details 

Step 2. We will forward you our Financial Health Check Form to complete; this will only take 2 mins to complete. 

Step 3. We will then contact you about your capacity to move ahead with us. If a Rent2own doesn't appeal to you, we always have a lending arm to lend you your deposit to move ahead with the bank. 

Why choose Rent to Own? How does this work? Why Rent2own? Our Rent2own Program is for individuals and families who do not qualify for traditional mortgage financing. Tenants enrolled in our program have a clear strategy to becoming homeowners soon while improving and building their credit report.
